### Files:

- `sqlFunctions.php`: Contains functions responsible for connecting to DB and fetching data
- `index.php`: Contains multiple functions and the pagination functions that fetches data from DB and then divide them into pages.
- `pagination.sql`: sql mock data with one table *user_details* and multiple columns. This serves only as an example and data are not important.
